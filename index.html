        <h4>Srting Hashing</h4>
        <blockquote cite = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-hashing-using-polynomial-rolling-hash-function/">Source file link"
        <p>String hashing is the way to convert a string into an integer known as a hash of that string.
        An ideal hashing is the one in which there are minimum chances of collision (i.e 2 different strings having the same hash).
       Polynomial rolling hash function.In this hashing technique, the hash of a string is calculated as:
         hash = (s[0]*P^{0} + s[1]*P^{1} + ....s[m]*P^{m}) mod M        
        Where P and M are some positive numbers.  And s[0], s[1], s[2] … s[n-1] are the values assigned to each character in English alphabet (a->1, b->2, … z->26).
